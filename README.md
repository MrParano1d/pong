# Pong Game

- Language: Golang
- Graphics: OpenGL
- ECS: [github.com/mrparano1d/ecs](https://github.com/mrparano1d/ecs)

## State

The project is still in the early stages of learning and therefore is not close to being a game or even Pong.

## Why?

This is just a project to learn the basic principles of game development. For this I have chosen OpenGL.
Why in Go and not C or C++? I love Go and also know about the problem of garbage collector in games, yet I think it won't make a problem in small games and I just enjoy the programming language and its ecosystem 1000 times more than C or C++.

## Run

```shell
go run main.go
```
